ℹ️ We provide ready-to-use downloads for the Unvanquished game on the Unvanquished [download page](https://unvanquished.net/download/), builds of the Dæmon engine are included.

<code style="color : red">!!! Daemon-vulkan builds are currently not included, you have to build it yourself !!!</code>

ℹ️ The repository of the source code for the game logic of Unvanquished can be found [there](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished).

## Workspace requirements

To fetch and build Dæmon-vulkan, you'll need:
`git`,
`cmake`,
and a C++23 compiler.

The following are actively supported:
`gcc` ≥ 14,
`clang` ≥ 19,
Visual Studio/MSVC (at least Visual Studio 2022 17.4).

## Dependencies

Required:
`zlib`,
`libgmp`,
`libnettle`,
`libcurl`,
`SDL2`,
`GLEW`,
`libpng`,
`libjpeg` ≥ 8,
`libwebp` ≥ 0.2.0,
`Freetype`,
`OpenAL`,
`libogg`,
`libvorbis`,
`libopus`,
`libopusfile`.

Optional:
`ncurses`.

### MSYS2

MSYS2 is the recommended way to build using MinGW on a Windows host.

Required packages for 64-bit: `mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`, `mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake`, `make`  
Required packages for 32-bit: `mingw-w64-i686-gcc`, `mingw-w64-i686-cmake`, `make`

## Downloading the sources for the game engine

Daemon-vulkan requires several sub-repositories to be fetched before compilation. If you have not yet cloned this repository:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon-vulkan.git
```

If you have already cloned:

```sh
cd Daemon/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

ℹ️ If cmake complains about missing files in `libs/crunch/` folder or similar issue then you have skipped this step.

## Build Instructions

💡️ Instead of `-j4` you can use `-jN` where `N` is your number of CPU cores to distribute compilation on them. Linux systems usually provide a handy `nproc` tool that tells the number of CPU core so you can just do `-j$(nproc)` to use all available cores.

Enter the directory before anything else:

```sh
cd Daemon/
```

### Visual Studio

  1. Run CMake.
  2. Choose your compiler.
  3. Open `Daemon.sln` and compile.

### NatVis Support
  NatVis files are contained in `/src/engine/renderer-vulkan/VSSupport/`. You can use them to get the custom visualisation for Daemon-vulkan containers in VS/VS Code. You may need to add them to the project (in Visual Studio right-click on the project -> Existing Item... -> Select the .natvis files).

### Linux, macOS, MSYS2

Produced files will be stored in a new directory named `build`.

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build -- -j4
```

### Linux cross-compile to Windows

💡️ For a 32-bit build use the `cross-toolchain-mingw32.cmake` toolchain file instead.

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/cross-toolchain-mingw64.cmake
cmake --build build -- -j4
```

## Running a game

ℹ️ On Windows you'll have to use `daemon-vulkan.exe` and `daemonded.exe` instead of `./daemon-vulkan` and `./daemonded`, everything else will be the same.

To run a game you would need a `pkg/` folder full of `.dpk` files provided by the Dæmon-based game you want to run. This `pkg/` folder has to be stored next to the `daemon` binary.

You then run the game this way:

```
./daemon-vulkan
```

If you want to run a dedicated server, you may want to use the non-graphical `daemonded` server binary and start a map this way:

```
./daemonded +map <mapname>
```

Map names and other options may be [specific to the game](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished#configuring-the-server).
